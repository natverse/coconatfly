* `cf_meta()` gets a `MoreArgs` argument to pass on to subsidiary functions for 
  each dataset
* Using this `cf_cosine_plot()` and friends now prefer malecns foreign types 
  (flywireType, mancType) when available and co-clustering with another dataset

# coconatfly 0.2.0

Although coconatfly has been in use for some time, this is the first stable 
release. It corresponds to what was used in the recent publication:

Schlegel, P., Yin, Y., Bates, A.S. et al. 
Whole-brain annotation and multi-connectome cell typing of Drosophila. 
Nature 634, 139â€“152 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07686-5

The release is motivated in part because of some forthcoming changes that will
slightly alter some core functionality of the package.
