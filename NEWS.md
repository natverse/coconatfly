# coconatfly (development version)

* warn but still complete without errors when there are no partners at all for
  inputs or ouptuts in `cf_partners()`. An example of when this happens is when
  running `cf_cosine_plot()` for sensory neurons where all the inputs are below
  threshold. #36

# coconatfly 0.2.3

* empty query fixes for all keys and banc metadata by @jefferis in https://github.com/natverse/coconatfly/pull/34
* Fix malecns class in `cf_partners()` by @jefferis in https://github.com/natverse/coconatfly/pull/35
* also support for rootSide in malecns in #35

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/natverse/coconatfly/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3


# coconatfly 0.2.2

* support malecns superclass/class/subclass change. To stay backward compatible 
  for the time being the class hierarchy is mapped onto
  - class
  - subclass
  - subsubclass
  but the intent is to switch to superclass/class/subclass in the next version
  by @jefferis in https://github.com/natverse/coconatfly/pull/32
* Correct handling of malecns lineage information by @jefferis in https://github.com/natverse/coconatfly/pull/33
* `cf_cosine_plot()` now fetches all metadata cols by default (f1667a3c8318120626ae95c2116f73576fd2dfb4)
* fix: pass on `keep.all` when `cf_meta()` receives keys
* `cf_cosine_plot()`: Now reports % of partner connections kept across datasets.

# coconatfly 0.2.1

* `cf_meta()` gets a `MoreArgs` argument to pass on to subsidiary functions for 
  each dataset
* Using this `cf_cosine_plot()` and friends now prefer malecns foreign types 
  (flywireType, mancType) when available and co-clustering with another dataset
  by @jefferis in https://github.com/natverse/coconatfly/pull/27
* `cf_meta()`: new `keep.all` argument keep all columns, not just shared columns
  by @jefferis in https://github.com/natverse/coconatfly/pull/30
* support for min_datasets in cosine clustering 
  by @jefferis in https://github.com/natverse/coconatfly/pull/31

# coconatfly 0.2.0

Although coconatfly has been in use for some time, this is the first stable 
release. It corresponds to what was used in the recent publication:

Schlegel, P., Yin, Y., Bates, A.S. et al. 
Whole-brain annotation and multi-connectome cell typing of Drosophila. 
Nature 634, 139â€“152 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07686-5

The release is motivated in part because of some forthcoming changes that will
slightly alter some core functionality of the package.
