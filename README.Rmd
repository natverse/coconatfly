**coconatfly** enables comparative/integrative connectomics across Drosophila datasets.
The philosophy is to provide access to the most important
functions for connectome analysis in a way that is both convenient and 
uniform across Drosophila datasets. 
The package builds upon the [coconat](https://natverse.org/coconat/)
package which provides more basic and/or dataset agnostic functionality. In case
you were wondering, **coconat** stands for COmparative COnnectomics for the NATverse
and **coconatfly** enables this specifically for fly datasets.

Although the code is already in active use, especially for comparison of the
hemibrain and flywire datasets, it remains experimental.
Therefore the interface should not yet been relied upon. In particular,
it is quite likely that refactoring will abstract more functionality into
[coconat](https://natverse.org/coconat/) as time goes by in order to enable
more core functionality to be reused.

## Datasets

At present the following datasets are supported (dataset names used in the package in brackets):

1. Janelia hemibrain (**hemibrain**)
2. Female Adult Fly Brain - [FlyWire connectome](https://flywire.ai/) (**flywire**)
3. [Janelia male Ventral Nerve Cord](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem/manc-connectome) (**manc**)
4. Wei Lee, John Tuthill and colleagues [Female Adult Nerve Cord](https://github.com/htem/FANC_auto_recon) (**fanc**)
5. Janelia Male CNS (**malecns**)
6. Janelia Male Optic Lobe (part of the malecns) (**opticlobe**)
7. Wei Lee and colleagues [Brain and Nerve Cord](https://github.com/jasper-tms/the-BANC-fly-connectome/wiki) (**banc**)

Datasets 1-4 and 6, 7 are either public (hemibrain, manc, flywire, opticlobe) or 
access can be requested subject to agreeing to certain terms of use (fanc, banc). 
The Male CNS dataset is currently undergoing 
proofreading and annotation in a collaboration between the 
[FlyEM](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem) and 
[Cambridge Drosophila Connectomics Group](https://flyconnecto.me). Release is
anticipated late 2024.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **coconatfly** like so:

``` r
install.packages('natmanager')
natmanager::install(pkgs = 'coconatfly')
```

Some of the datasets exposed by **coconatfly** require authentication for access or
are still being annotated in private pre-release. Please consult individual 
package dependencies for authentication details and do not be surprised if you
do not have access to all datasets at this time.

For installation of private packages (currently restricted to the male cns
dataset being developed with our collaborators at the 
[FlyEM Team at Janelia](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem))
you will need a GITHUB_PAT (Personal Access Token - an alternative to 
a username+password). 

This code checks if you have a PAT GITHUB_PAT and offers to make one if necessary.

```{r eval=FALSE}
natmanager::check_pat()
```

## An example

First let's load the libraries we need
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(coconatfly)
library(dplyr)
```

Two important functions are `cf_ids()` which allows you to specify a set of
neurons from one or more datasets and `cf_meta()` which fetches information
about the cell type. 
For example let's fetch information about DA1 projection neurons:

```{r}
cf_meta(cf_ids('DA1_lPN', datasets = 'hemibrain'))
```

We can also do that for multiple brain datasets

```{r}
da1meta <- cf_meta(cf_ids('DA1_lPN', datasets = c('hemibrain', 'flywire')))
head(da1meta)
```

```{r}
da1meta %>% 
  count(dataset, side)
```

We can also fetch connectivity for these neurons: 

```{r}
da1ds <- da1meta %>% 
  cf_partners(threshold = 5, partners = 'output')
head(da1ds)
```

```{r}
da1ds %>% 
  group_by(type, dataset, side) %>% 
  summarise(weight=sum(weight), npre=n_distinct(pre_id), npost=n_distinct(post_id))
```

Let's restrict that to types that are observed in both datasets. We do this
by counting how many distinct datasets exist for each type in the results.

```{r, }
da1ds.shared_types.wide <- da1ds %>% 
  filter(!(dataset=='hemibrain' & side=='L')) %>% # drop truncated hemibrain LHS 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  mutate(datasets_type=n_distinct(dataset)) %>% 
  filter(datasets_type>1) %>% 
  group_by(type, dataset, side) %>% 
  summarise(weight=sum(weight)) %>% 
  mutate(shortdataset=abbreviate_datasets(dataset)) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = type, names_from = c(shortdataset,side), 
                     values_from = weight, values_fill = 0)
da1ds.shared_types.wide
```

With the data organised like this, we can easily compare the connection strengths
between the cell types across hemispheres:

```{r flywire-left-vs-right}
library(ggplot2)
da1ds.shared_types.wide %>% 
  filter(type!='KCg-m') %>% 
  ggplot(data=., aes(fw_L, fw_R)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x + 0) +
  geom_abline(slope=1, linetype='dashed')
```

... and across datasets:

```{r flywire-vs-hemibrain}
da1ds.shared_types.wide %>% 
  filter(type!='KCg-m') %>% 
  ggplot(data=., aes(fw_R, hb_R)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x + 0) +
  geom_abline(slope=1, linetype='dashed')
```

## Across dataset connectivity clustering

Being able to fetch shared connectivity in a uniform format is a building block
for a range of analyses. For example, we can compare the connectivity of a set
of neurons that are believed to constitute the same cell type across multiple 
datasets. Cosine similarity clustering seems to work very well for this purpose.

```{r lal-cosine-cluster}
cf_cosine_plot(cf_ids('/type:LAL0(08|09|10|42)', datasets = c("flywire", "hemibrain")))
```

Each row (and column) correspond to a single neuron. Rows are labelled by cell 
type, dataset and hemisphere; due to truncation hemibrain neurons sometimes 
exist in one hemisphere, sometimes both.
Notice that LAL009 and LAL010 neurons from each hemisphere co-cluster together
exactly as we would expect for a cell type conserved across brains. In contrast
LAL008 and LAL042 are intermingled; we believe that these constitute a single
cell type of two cells / hemisphere (i.e. they should not have been split into
two cell types in the hemibrain).

You can also see that cells from one hemibrain hemisphere often cluster slightly
oddly (e.g. 387687146) - this is likely due to truncation of the axons or dendrites of these cells
or a paucity of partners from the left hand side of the hemibrain. 

## Going further

We strongly recommend consulting the online manual visible at https://natverse.org/coconatfly/. In particular the vignette(s) listed at
https://natverse.org/coconatfly/articles provide full code and instructions 
for a step by step walk through.
