## Intro

In Fig 6 of our manuscript [Schlegel et al 2023](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.27.546055) we show an example of across-dataset cell typing using AOTU063 as an example.

![Fig 6A Schlegel et al 2023 bioRxiv](AOTU063-Fig6A.png)

We should be able to recapitulate the basic features of this analysis here.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(coconatfly)
library(dplyr)
```

For this analysis we will use the version 630 connectivity / annotation data
released in June 2023. We will set an option use the lower level fafbseg package
to ensure this.

```{r}
fafbseg::flywire_connectome_data_version(set = 630)
```

You may need to download the relevant data dumps if you have not done so previously.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fafbseg::download_flywire_release_data(version = 630)
```

```{r}
aotu63=cf_meta(cf_ids(query = '/type:AOTU063.*', datasets = c("flywire","hemibrain")))
aotu63
```

```{r}
aotu63 %>%
  cf_cosine_plot()
```

We can get the dendrogram for this clustering

```{r}
aotu63.hc = cf_cosine_plot(aotu63, heatmap = FALSE)
plot(aotu63.hc)
```

And then cut it in two and extract those two clusters using the `coconat::add_cluster_info()` helper function.

```{r}
aotu63=coconat::add_cluster_info(aotu63, dend=aotu63.hc, k=2)
aotu63 %>% 
  select(side, type, dataset, group_k2, key) %>% 
  arrange(group_k2, side)
```

So from this we can see that group 2 seems to the "b" type.

## Finding the partners that define the types

What might distinguish these two types? We can fetch, say, the input partners, and then look at how connection strength varies across the types.

To get started let's redefine the type of our 6 query neurons based on the clustering. Then fetch the input partners and merge in the the AOTU063 type (i.e. AOTU063a or AOTU063b) as a new column called `qtype`

```{r}
aotu63v2=aotu63 %>% 
  mutate(type=case_when(
    group_k2==1 ~ 'AOTU063a',
    group_k2==2 ~ 'AOTU063b'
  ))
aotu63in <- cf_partners(aotu63, partners = 'in', threshold = 10)
aotu63in
```

```{r}
# note that AOTU063 neurons will be the postsynaptic partners in this dataframe
aotu63in <- aotu63in %>% 
  left_join(
    aotu63v2 %>% mutate(qtype=type) %>% select(qtype, key),
    by=c("post_key"='key'))
aotu63in %>% 
  select(weight, type, qtype)
```

Ok with that preparatory work we can now make a summary of the inputs across the different types and datasets. This pipeline is a little more involved, 
but I have commented extensively and if you follow step by step it does make
sense.

```{r}
aotu63in %>% 
  mutate(dataset=abbreviate_datasets(dataset)) %>% 
  # FlyWire has e.g. LC10a LC10c annotated, but not hemibrain
  mutate(type=case_when(
    grepl("LC10", type) ~ "LC10",
    T ~ type
  )) %>% 
  # summarise the connection strength by query cell type, data set 
  # and partner (downstream) cell type
  group_by(qtype, dataset, type) %>% 
  summarise(weight=sum(weight)) %>% 
  # sort with strongest partners first
  arrange(desc(weight)) %>% 
  # make four columns, one for each query type / dataset combination 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from = c(qtype, dataset), 
    values_from = weight, 
    values_fill = 0) %>% 
  # convert from synaptic counts to percentages of total input
  mutate(across(-type, ~round(100*.x/sum(.x))))
```

So we can see that the top few cell types already suggest a number of likely explanations.

For example LC10 provides 10% more input for AOTU063a vs AOTU063b while LT52 input is much stronger for AOTU063b than AOTU063a. Crucially these patterns are consistent across datasets.

### Distinctive output partners

```{r}
aotu63out <- cf_partners(aotu63, partners = 'out', threshold = 10)

aotu63out <- aotu63out %>% 
  left_join(
    aotu63v2 %>% mutate(qtype=type) %>% select(qtype, key),
    by=c("pre_key"='key'))

aotu63out %>% 
  mutate(dataset=abbreviate_datasets(dataset)) %>% 
  # FlyWire has e.g. LC10a LC10c annotated, but not hemibrain
  mutate(type=case_when(
    grepl("LC10", type) ~ "LC10",
    T ~ type
  )) %>% 
  group_by(qtype, dataset, type) %>% 
  summarise(weight=sum(weight)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(weight)) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = c(qtype, dataset), values_from = weight, values_fill = 0) %>% 
  # convert from raw to pct
  mutate(across(-type, ~round(100*.x/sum(.x))))

```

Here things are not quite obvious but IB008/IB010 look different and some of the newly defined DNs in FlyWire like DNde002/DNbe004/DNae011 look like they might be interesting.
